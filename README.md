## About me :computer:
Hey there! I’m Teerasan Rattanaruengkul (but I usually goes by Bung, or BungkapTH/BungTH if you see me online), and I come from Surat Thani, Thailand. Think of it as that feeling of being a ‘เด๊กต่างจังหวัดเข้ากรุง’—moving from the calm of my hometown to the vibrant energy of the city! I hold a degree in Computer Engineering, but my passions go beyond the technical realm. I’m deeply fascinated by psychology and love to contemplate life’s mysteries while hanging out with random cats.

## Thinking about :building_construction:
I want to somehow show my latest Medium blog post here; maybe I'll use this [blog](https://pahlevikun.medium.com/beautify-your-github-account-by-adding-your-latest-medium-posts-to-github-profile-readme-2446ee133cb2) to help with this pet project.

## Hobbies and Interests :monocle_face:
In my free time, you can find me:
- Writing blogs
- Exploring the world of Linux (currently daily driving Arch Linux, but I might switch distros soon!)
- Enjoying Wes Anderson movies
- Listening to Vocaloid music
